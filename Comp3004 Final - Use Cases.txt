1. Once the timer has been set, current will default to 1 (100µA).
2. User presses the increase button, increasing current power, until the ideal current is reached.
3. Once a sense of Vertigo is felt, user decreases the current until sense of Vertigo is no longer felt.
4. Afterwards, User presses the lock Button twice in order to keep the current at the same power.
Post Condition: Timer reaches zero
Extensions:
        1a. User experiences, “tapping,” in the ears
                1a1. Users must decrease voltage immediately. 
2a. User has a preconditional predisposition for Vertigo and experiences residual Vertigo.
        2a1. Users should use default settings in order to prevent residual vertigo.

Use Case 7 - Notify 5% battery:[c] (Suggestion: Battery Warning and Shutoff)
Primary Actor: CES device
Level:User
Precondition: The device has power and is turned on
Main Success Scenario: 
1. The battery remaining reaches 5%.
2. Device issues a warning to the user that the battery is low.
3. Battery falls to 3%[d][e], device issues another warning to the user that the battery is low and the device will shut off soon.

Things to think about/Questions:
Can the user turn off the device during a treatment?[h]
Should we just make it rechargeable instead of having batteries?
[i]Can you change the frequency during treatment? The current?
[j]If they can, should we reset the timer if they do or continue?
[k]
           


[a]Maybe just causes it to shut down as the increased amperage drains the battery?
[b]Yes I believe you can, as long as it is not "locked"
[c]Could be a case, may have worded this weirdly
[d]the actual percentage the second warning occurs is not listed so I just picked 3%.
Content of the warning isnt really mentioned
[e]I think that works, it's a feature that we see that works!
[f]Cant really seem to find any way listed on implementing this in the Alpha Stim guide so ive just made up a way : )
We arent supposed to/required to recreate the Alpha-Stim exactly so we could also just add a button which I think is easier
[g]Since it's cycling between frequencies, maybe it would be better to call the button Cycle?
[h]Probably? I imagine that since the power button is something you need to hold down to press, that any presses should be intentional.
[i]Since its a simulator, We can just add a Recharge button to simulate it getting energy
[j]You can change the current but not the frequency i think
[k]It appears modifying the current is a part of treatment. The timer should continue
